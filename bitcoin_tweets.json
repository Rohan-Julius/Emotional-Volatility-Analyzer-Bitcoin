    "text": "Wishing a Happy Birthday🎂today to former @CelsiusNetwork CEO Alex @Mashinsky who worked tirelessly for 5 years to build a once $32 bn AUM crypto company that was the envy of everyone.  He also had the wisdom to direct company capital into #Bitcoin Mining Operation now giving us a golden goose known at @IonicDigital.  It is a travesty of justice that this man was scapegoated and sentenced to 12 years in prison under the Biden administration.  They basically locked him up for his words, not his actions.  He never stole a single penny from his Customers.  Only took actions to protect them from others trying to harm the company for their own financial gain.  @POTUS really should pardon this man who was the target of corrupt SDNY clowns and anti-crypto zealots like @ewarren.  Justice delayed is justice denied. @DOJCrimDiv",

    "text": "นี่คือการวิเคราะห์ ถ้า Supreme Court of the United States (หรือ “ศาลฎีกาสหรัฐ”) ตัดสินว่า ภาษีศุลกากร (tariffs) ที่ Donald Trump ใช้บังคับนั้น “ผิดกฎหมาย” — ผลกระทบจะเป็นอย่างไร และจะส่งผลต่อตลาดคริปโต เช่น Ethereum, Bitcoin หรือไม่\n\n⸻\n\n1. สถานะและความเป็นไปได้\n•ปัจจุบันมีคดีที่ศาลอุทธรณ์ระบุว่าภาษีศุลกากรที่ Trump ใช้ภายใต้ International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) นั้น “เกินขอบเขตอำนาจประธานาธิบดี” ตามกฎหมายสหรัฐฯ  \n•รายงานจากหลายแหล่งประเมินว่า ถ้าศาลฎีกาสหรัฐยกเลิกภาษีเหล่านั้น รัฐบาลสหรัฐอาจต้องคืนเงินภาษีที่เก็บไปแล้ว มูลค่าสูงถึง หลายแสนล้านดอลลาร์  \n•ผลลัพธ์นี้ไม่ใช่เรื่องการเมืองอย่างเดียว แต่มีผลต่ออำนาจรัฐ อำนาจประธานาธิบดี และระบบการค้าระหว่างประเทศด้วย  \n\n⸻\n\n2. ผลกระทบต่อเศรษฐกิจโดยรวม\n\nถ้าผลการตัดสินคือ “ภาษีเหล่านั้นผิดกฎหมาย / ถูกยกเลิก” ผลกระทบที่น่าจะเกิดขึ้น เช่น\n\n✅ ผลบวก\n•ลดความไม่แน่นอนทางนโยบายการค้าของสหรัฐ ซึ่งเป็นบวกต่อความเชื่อมั่นของนักลงทุน  \n•หากผู้ประกอบการนำเข้าหรือส่งออกได้รับการคืนเงินภาษี อาจเพิ่มสภาพคล่องในภาคธุรกิจ  \n•อาจช่วยลดแรงกดดันในด้านต้นทุนการนำเข้า ลดแรงกดดันเงินเฟ้อ  \n\n❗ ผลลบ / ความเสี่ยง\n•หากต้องคืนภาษีจำนวนมหาศาล อาจกดดันงบประมาณของรัฐบาล และอาจสร้างความกังวลทางการเงิน  \n•ความไม่แน่นอนในช่วงถือว่า “รอผล” อาจทำให้ธุรกิจชะลอการลงทุน หรือตัดสินใจช้า  \n•ถ้านโยบายการค้าผันผวนมาก อาจมีผลต่อการเติบโตของเศรษฐกิจโดยรวม: มีการประเมินว่าภาษีที่อยู่ในสถานะเสี่ยงอาจลด GDP สหรัฐได้ประมาณ 0.2-0.8%  \n\n⸻\n\n3. ผลกระทบต่อตลาดคริปโต (รวมถึง Ethereum)\n\nโดยตรงแล้ว ภาษีศุลกากรการนำเข้า/ส่งออกไม่ใช่ประเด็นหลักของตลาดคริปโต แต่ โดยอ้อม มีช่องทางที่อาจส่งผล ดังนี้:\n\nช่องทางที่อาจส่งผล\n•หากเศรษฐกิจสหรัฐฯ หรือโลกโดยรวมได้รับผลกระทบ (ชะลอการเติบโต, ความเชื่อมั่นลด) นักลงทุนอาจย้ายไปหา “สินทรัพย์หลบภัย” หรือกลยุทธ์เสี่ยงต่ำ ซึ่งอาจมีทั้งผลบวกและผลลบต่อตลาดคริปโต\n•ถ้าภาวะเงินเฟ้อ, อัตราดอกเบี้ย, หรือสภาพคล่องของตลาดการเงินเปลี่ยนแปลง — เนื่องจากผลทางนโยบายการค้าหรือการคืนภาษี — ตลาดคริปโตอาจ “ได้รับแรงสั่น” จากสภาพคล่องหรือความเสี่ยงโดยรวม\n•ความไม่แน่นอนทางนโยบาย (policy uncertainty) มักก่อให้เกิดความเคลื่อนไหวที่แรงขึ้นในสินทรัพย์เสี่ยง เช่นคริปโต\n\nกรณีเฉพาะกับ Ethereum\n•ถ้าเศรษฐกิจสหรัฐหรือโลกชะลอ นักลงทุนอาจลดการถือครองคริปโต หรือเลื่อนการลงทุน → อาจกดราคา Ethereum ลง\n•ในทางกลับกัน ถ้าผลคือการ “คลายความกดดัน” ทางนโยบาย หรือสภาพคล่องเพิ่มขึ้น นักลงทุนอาจกลับเข้าคริปโตเร็วขึ้น → ส่งผลบวก\n•แต่ควรถือว่าวิธีนี้ ไม่ใช่ เหมือนการวิเคราะห์ตราสารทุนโดยตรง — ตลาดคริปโตมีปัจจัยเฉพาะ (เช่น เทคโนโลยี, กฎระเบียบคริปโต) ที่มีบทบาทมาก\n\nสรุป\n\nโดยรวม: ใช่ — มีโอกาสที่ตลาดคริปโตจะได้รับผลจากการตัดสินเรื่องภาษีศุลกากรอย่างนี้ แต่ ไม่ใช่ ผลกระทบโดยตรงหรือแน่นอน เป็นผลจาก “ภาพรวมเศรษฐกิจ” และ “ความเชื่อมั่นตลาด” มากกว่า\n\n⸻\n\n4. สิ่งที่ควรติดตามต่อไป\n•ผลการตัดสินของศาลฎีกาสหรัฐในคดีนี้ — จะมีกำหนดตัดสินเมื่อไร และมีข้อจำกัดอย่างไร  \n•ผลกระทบต่อภาคนำเข้า/ส่งออกของสหรัฐ — จำนวนเงินที่อาจต้องคืนภาษี และผลต่อบริษัทใหญ่  \n•สัญญาณทางเศรษฐกิจ: GDP, เงินเฟ้อ, อัตราดอกเบี้ย, สภาพคล่องตลาด — เพราะสภาพเหล่านี้ส่งผลต่อคริปโต\n•ปัจจัยภายในตลาดคริปโตเอง: กฎระเบียบ, เทคโนโลยี, ความเชื่อมั่น — เพราะแม้เศรษฐกิจดี แต่ถ้าคริปโตมีข่าวร้าย ก็อาจไม่ดีขึ้น",

    "text": "Estamos viviendo “El Gran Shakeout de 2025”, una limpieza histórica del mercado crypto, justo a las puertas de rallys alcistas importantes en Bitcoin y en las altcoins. \n\nNo he recibido la confirmación de que estamos en un BearMarket, el precio de BTC ha aguantado por encima de la MA50 SEMANAL, y ha rebotado en la línea de tendencia alcista iniciada en Enero 2023.\n\nMuchos están perdiendo dinero y fe, pero esto no ha terminado: solo pierdes si vendes. El apalancamiento puede ser muy útil para maximizar ganancias, pero si operas con un apalancamiento excesivamente elevado, perderás dinero, las whales buscarán liquidarte. Si operas en futuros debes tener una gran gestión del riesgo.\n\nMientras algunos proyectan el inicio de un Bear Market, los datos dicen lo contrario: vienen recortes de tipos, fin del QT, nueva liquidez, ETFs, adopción institucional y países comprando crypto. Además, ha iniciado el QE en China.\n\nEl futuro en Crypto, tanto a corto, como medio y largo plazo, es alcista. Compra proyectos sólidos, mantén la calma y no vendas en pánico.\n\nNo es asesoramiento financiero. Dyor.",

    "text": "Latest News on XRP.\n\nXRP dropped 2.55% to $2.26 USD over the past 24 hours, underperforming Bitcoin's 2.5% decline and the cryptocurrency market's 1.68% drop.\n\n$XRP is facing expectations around ETFs and adoption from major institutions amid strong market volatility. \n\n1. ETF Race Heats Up (November 5, 2025) – Franklin Templeton filed a key amendment with the SEC to expedite the XRP ETF approval process, with a projected launch by late November.\n2. Enhanced Derivatives for Institutions (November 5, 2025) – Bitnomial expanded its margin program for the XRP/RLUSD pair, integrating Ripple assets into leveraged trading.\n3. Launch of First Stablecoin ETP (November 5, 2025) – Virtune introduced Europe's first stablecoin-focused ETP, with 23.5% weighting in XRP, expanding access opportunities for institutional investors.\n\nDetailed Analysis\n1. ETF Race Heats Up \n\nFranklin Templeton filed an S-1 amendment for the XRP ETF, removing the possibility of SEC delaying approval as requirements have been met. This strategy mirrors previous Bitcoin/ETH ETFs. Canary Funds also updated its filing, aiming for a mid-November launch. Experts suggest this could set a precedent for other issuers like Bitwise.\n\nThis is very positive for XRP, as ETF approval would open up regulated access for traditional investors, potentially boosting liquidity. However, if the SEC delays or opposes it, uncertainty could persist. \n\n2. Enhanced Derivatives for Institutions \n\n- Bitnomial, a CFTC-regulated exchange, now accepts XRP and RLUSD as margin collateral for institutional derivatives trading. Retail users will soon gain access via the Botanical platform, further integrating XRP with mainstream finance.\n\n- This is neutral to positive, as derivatives adoption signals institutional confidence but could also heighten price volatility. Greater RLUSD usage may reinforce XRP's role in cross-border payments. \n\n3. Launch of First Stablecoin ETP\n\nVirtune launched Europe's first stablecoin index ETP, with XRP comprising 23.5%. The product aims to foster blockchain infrastructure growth, with RLUSD adoption seen as a key factor.\n\nThis is a positive signal for the XRP ecosystem, as regulated ETPs often attract safe investment capital. However, XRP's 15.82% drop over the past 7 days indicates the market remains skeptical about short-term gains. \n\nConclusion\nXRP's trajectory hinges heavily on ETF approval and RLUSD adoption, but technical weaknesses (testing support at $2.10) and broader market caution (CMC Fear & Greed Index: 20) temper the optimism. Will institutional momentum be enough to overcome the bearish signals on the charts?\n\n@EdgenTech #XRP",

    "text": "The Prisoner’s Dilemma: How Satoshi Nakamoto Broke the Game and Rewired the World with Bitcoin SV\n\nThe Setup: A World Trapped in the Game\n\nThe world has been trapped in a silent prison — one built not of walls, but of incentives.\nEvery system we know, from politics to finance to social media, runs on The Prisoner’s Dilemma:\n\n“If everyone cooperates, we all win. But if one defects, the honest players lose.”\n\nIt’s the logic behind market manipulation, centralized banks, data monopolies, and fake “decentralization.” Humanity has been playing this game for centuries — choosing short-term survival over long-term truth.\n\nAnd then came Satoshi Nakamoto.\nBut what if Satoshi never disappeared?\nWhat if the man behind the mask, Dr. Craig Wright, didn’t just create Bitcoin — but solved the Prisoner’s Dilemma itself?\n\nThe Move: Building a System That Rewards Cooperation\n\nBitcoin SV isn’t just a blockchain. It’s a mirror — showing how human cooperation can be mathematically enforced.\nIt flips the old dilemma on its head:\n\nIn the old world, lying and cheating were profitable.\n\nIn the BSV world, truth and honesty are economically superior.\n\nEvery transaction, every timestamp, every digital signature becomes a record of cooperation. It’s a system where defection no longer pays — because transparency kills deception.\nThis is not philosophy. It’s game theory, written in code.\n\nThe Betrayal: The Fork That Tested Humanity\n\nWhen the world split Bitcoin, it wasn’t just a technical fork — it was a moral one.\nBTC chose scarcity theater, marketing, and memes.\nBSV chose scalability, law, and reality.\n\nCraig Wright, like a prisoner who refused to defect, stayed silent while the others took the easy deal.\nHe knew that the real victory wasn’t about price — it was about restoring truth to the digital economy.\n\nIn The Prisoner’s Dilemma, cooperation only becomes stable when the players know that their actions will be recorded forever.\nThat’s exactly what Bitcoin SV does.\nIt’s the ultimate truth machine.\n\nThe Revelation: Infinite Scale, Infinite Proof\n\nWhile others chase narratives, BSV chases scale — millions of transactions per second, each one notarized by proof-of-work.\nThat scale isn’t about speed — it’s about honesty at global magnitude.\nImagine every action, every contract, every lie or truth permanently recorded, verifiable, and enforceable.\n\nThat’s not just blockchain.\nThat’s civilization upgraded.\n\nThe Twist: The Dilemma Is Over\n\nThe irony?\nThe crypto world laughed at Craig Wright for claiming to be Satoshi — yet they all still play by the same broken rules he came to replace.\n\nBitcoin SV is not about belief. It’s about logic.\nIt doesn’t ask for faith — it provides evidence.\nAnd that’s how you escape the dilemma:\n\nWhen truth is more profitable than deceit, freedom begins.\n\nConclusion: The World Hasn’t Caught Up Yet\n\nWhile others build castles on volatility, BSV builds the infrastructure of digital law, enterprise truth, and micropayment economies.\nDr. Craig Wright didn’t invent money.\nHe reinvented trust.\n\nThe game is over.\nThe Prisoner’s Dilemma has been solved.\nOnly a few realize they’re free.\n\n@BsvCrypto @kurtwuckertjr",

What if tokens could truly move freely on Bitcoin itself, without relying on external chains or “bridges” that introduce risk? \n\nBeyond is asking that question, and more importantly, working on delivering the infrastructure. Their commitment to building a native Layer 1 interoperability protocol on Bitcoin is not just technical, it’s philosophical. It speaks to trust, decentralization, and rethinking how we transport value across the digital economy.",

It’s the USA’s largest bank allowing bitcoin as collateral. \n\nI.e. don’t ever sell it!! Use it as collateral to take a loan from me “Pawn Broker style” and what you earn in interest on it will be more than what I will be loaning you money at !!! Meaning I’m just giving you money and the value of your asset is increasing faster than the interest I am charging you for the advance loan 🤷‍♂️😉\n\nBitcoin ……\n\nAt Bitcoin price right now that’s 5% of $9.5 trillion = is four hundred and seventy five billion dollars.\n\nfour hundred and seventy five billion dollars divided by $104,000 = 475,000,000,000 / $104,000 =4,567,307.69\n\nA little over 4.5 million bitcoin.\n\nThere are only 21,000,000 bitcoin ever in existence. \n\nOn exchanges today there are 2,000,000 \n\nA portion of which around 50% is owned by somebody. \n\nLeaving 1,000,000 left for sale. \n\nJust so we are clear, the US pension fund alone wants 5,000,000 of them 🤷‍♂️\n\nIn order to have one, you pay the price that someone is willing to sell for, hence Bitcoin !!!\n\nInevitable, checkmate, and why would I ever sell it when all it does is make me money 🤷‍♂️😂\n\nHence HODL, BUY WHAT YOU CAN experts say 5% of what you are worth and what you can afford to not spend nor be without for 4 years and let that baby earn 10x + 🤷‍♂️ 🫡 \n\nAnd ride the wave ✌️ \n\nBitcoin checkmate 👌",

As calm, centred and confident as ever. Rich McDonald brought some knowledgeable questions and Andrew’s answers were excellent. Highly recommend watching if you haven’t already. Link on the boss’ timeline @asjwebley.\n\nToday in the absence of any SWC news and with just a percentage point move in the underlying BTC the SWC share price increased 17%.\n\nImagine how it may start to move with larger BTC moves and / or SWC news once the current quiet period is over.\n\nTonight I leave you with the following thought…\n\nIt is clear to all there are now significantly more sats per share than May 22nd but ask yourself this… how many more BitcoinERS are there per share?\n\nHow much stronger is the shareholder base than back in May? \n\nHow many long term holders are there today than back in May? \n\nHow much more global recognition does SWC have today than back in May?\n\nHow much stronger is the company today than back in May?\n\n@ZynxBTC said this evening that at 0.9 mNAV SWC is criminally undervalued. \n\nYesterday mNAV was 0.83.\n\nI suspect it won’t be below 1 mNAV for much longer.\n\nAndrew can’t buy shares as it’s the year end quiet period. He said this morning that if he was Alex at a Capital B he’d be buying SWC shares now and whilst this is friendly supportive competition the numbers don’t lie.\n\nHere’s the SWC / Capital B pair chart. SWC remains massively undervalued vs Capital B.\n\nDo with this information what you will, and of course never financial advice.\n\nThe SWC is bright and very possibly brighter than many of us can truly comprehend.\n\nOnwards 🚀",

The real shift starts when it actually works for you.\n\nMost Bitcoin just sits in cold storage, valuable but inactive. @GOATRollup changes that by letting BTC earn without wrapping, selling, or leaving the network.\n\nIts staking model brings yield to Bitcoin instead of forcing holders to move their BTC somewhere else to find it.\n\nIf even a small part of that trillion-dollar supply becomes productive, Bitcoin stops being just a store of value and turns into a living economic engine.\n\nThat’s what it really means to upgrade what “holding BTC” is.",

    "text": "“CAGR only matters for new issuance” misses some nuance.  Anytime MSTR tops off its amplification with preferred stock (let’s say after Bitcoin does a 10x from here), they’re in roughly the same position risk-wise as they were before aside from hopefully their yield dropping.  Overall if they’re paying 10% dividend on 30% amplification, that’s still a 3% annual bleed regardless of when they issued different shares of prefs.\n\nIt’s not like Strategy has found a zero risk way to maintain 30% effective leverage for decades.  A method which gives them a shot at 4x-ing their “btc/share” and owning 15% of the 21 million bitcoin in 15-20 years (why do people even want one company to hold this much??) comes with high risk imo.\n\nAs you bring up, when Bitcoin is $2 mil, even a 20% return has it going to $2.4 mil in a year, then $2.84 mil etc.  does that sound reasonable to you?  I expect the power law model to break to the downside more quickly than people expect.\n\nThen the retort might be “well then you don’t believe in bitcoin anyway”.  I just don’t believe a $42 trillion asset will still be compounding at 20-30% a year like it is today.  It already has signs of slowing more quickly than expected.  2021 high was only 3.5x the 2017 high.  2025 high (so far anyway) is not even 2x the 2021 high (which wasn’t even a parabolic high).\n\nPerpetual means perpetual.  Strategy has shown us that, while trailblazing, they keep trying new things.  They used to have some bitcoin as debt collateral.  They used to (very recently) love convertible debt.  They still seem to believe their mNAV should be way above 2, though with each passing day the market disagrees as the company is larger and things can’t maintain high growth or premium as easily when they get larger.\n\nEven the way btc/share is counted (full and immediate) from Bitcoin bought with money raised through pref issuance isn’t honest imo.  Many others have said the same, this isn’t just me.  Ultimately, you don’t get to greatly outperform Bitcoin within the Bitcoin ecosystem without the mathematical risk being part of it.",

L’évolution des cours entre les deux actifs devraient désormais être beaucoup plus corrélée. $MSTR reste un pari spéculatif puisque la société achète du BTC en fragilisant son bilan en dollars, c’est une sorte de proxy avec effet de levier. Elle peut faire faillite si le bitcoin perd 80% (ce qui arrive pour l’instant tous les 4 ans…) Saylor va-t-il faire un remake de 2000?",

    "text": "Should we run if Bitcoin dips below the 1 year average (102K)?\n\nMy answer is clear: NO.\n\nWhy this isn’t November 2021\n\n1) Technical analysis is insufficient\n\nTA has strengths, but on its own it’s not enough.\nIt relies on two things:\n\n1- Price\n\n2- Volume\n\nBoth are outcomes. The market acts first; price/volume show the result. TA analyzes that result. That’s only half the job.\n\n2) Cost analysis\n\nThe other half is cost and investor behavior.\n\nAs Thaler’s behavioral finance reminds us, we’re not fully rational, very few make decisions 100% by data (me included :D). So cost matters. Two ways to view it 👇\n\n3) Measuring cost\n\nTradFi uses VWAP to estimate average cost from price × volume. Makes sense.\n\nOn-chain gives us something cleaner: Realized Price.\n\nSo why not bail BELOW 102K?\n\n1) 102K = 1-year moving average.\n\nWe haven’t closed below it this cycle, but we could. What matters is investor behavior around it.\n\n2) URPD (cost profile)\n\nOn the chart, RED = supply at a loss, GREEN = in profit.\n\nRight now 56% of liquidity sits at a loss because there’s a lot of cost above 100K: $616B.\n\nFor a structural downtrend, we’d likely need to live below 90–100K for a while and see whether those underwater holders actually sell.\n\n⚠️ This is key\n\nRemember: price and volume are results.\nI’m talking about what happens before it hits price.\n\nIf we tag 90K, another $100B of liquidity goes underwater. What do those holders do?\n\nThat’s where SOPR helps:\n\n- Who is selling?\n\n- Are losses being realized?\n\n- Are old coins just taking profit?\n\nOnly on-chain shows this cleanly.\n\nWhat do ETFs and treasury buyers do?\n\nFor ~2 years these groups drove ~35% of net new demand and acted as the locomotive. If they say “enough,” and SOPR shows capitulation from short term holders, then we’re in a different discussion. In the last two major sell offs (VIX spike, tariff shock) we didn’t see that.\n\nWhere we are now\n\nLoss realizing sales are still limited\n\nETF outflows are modest\n\nWe’re not facing a 2021 style rapid Fed hiking + fresh QT regime, if anything, the setup tilts toward future easing (QE)\n\nYes, it’s a tricky spot. Equities are rich and many are at ATHs. A normal equity correction could hit crypto hard and push more investors to say “enough.”\n\nAnyone speaking in absolutes about the future is fortune telling.\n\nThe right approach is to read a few key metrics well, not a hundred. I’m sharing the ones I track.\n\nThanks for reading 🙏",
